      "My passion for understanding what constitutes reality and how humans can influence it, lead me to major in Physics. My 4 years of experience and interaction with students and teachers ensured me that Computer Science is my main interest. I'm currently on my last year of studies and I'm looking forward to the next step of my career.",

      "My Thesis is about detecting clouds in images taken from low-cost sky cameras. The project is based on classifying different image pixels as cloudy or cloudless, depending on information from the RGB and HSV channels. The project is written in Python and the main libraries used are Numpy and Scikit-Image. The project is still in progress and I am currently working on perfecting the classification algorithm, in terms of efficiency and accuracy.",

      "Worked as Software Engineer, specialized in Web Development, at 7L International. At first, I took two Udemy Courses about React.js and Next.js. Also, I built REST APIs with Next.js and used them to make the Web Apps interact with a MongoDB Database. Alongside, I learned how to work in a team with git and git management systems (GitLab, GitHub). The last three weeks I prepared a Webinar, with a colleague, for the IT Team. The topic was a newly developed framework at that moment, Qwik.js, and a comparison with Remix.js. For the sake of the Webinar I also developed a Qwik.js app for showcase.",

      "Built a program that searches for and identifies displaced vertices, participating in New Particle Search at Cern. The program was written in C++ and have been developed around ROOT data analysis framework. The aim of the project was to compare the accuracy of algorithmic methods to human input and check how accurate the computer generated results can be. Furthermore, a paper was written so as to aggregate the results of the algorithm development.",

We were introduced to the basics of C and one of our first assignments was to write a program that calculates a complex integral. I was fascinated by the fact that I could write a program that calculates something that I couldn't do by hand.",
