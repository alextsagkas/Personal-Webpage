    duration: "4 years",
    details:
      "My passion for understanding what constitutes reality and how humans can influence it, lead me to major in Physics. My 4 years of experience and interaction with students and teachers ensured me that Computer Science is my main interest. I'm currently on my last year of studies and I'm looking forward to the next step of my career.",

    duration: "3 weeks",
    details:
      "My first publication is about my Bachelor Thesis and is submitted in Emerging Tech Conference Edge Intelligence 2023. It focuses on efficient solutions for the development of PV park controllers by comparing the results of applying the cloud coverage algorithm I developed to cameras of different costs. Furthermore, the cloud recognition capabilities are compared with the commercial software that is provided by the sky imagers' vendors.",

    duration: "8 months",
    details:
      "My Thesis is about detecting clouds in images taken from all-sky cameras (180 degree view of the sky). The project is based on classifying different image pixels as cloudy or cloudless, depending on information from the RGB and HSV channels, using an image segmentation, thresholding algorithm. It is written in Python and the main libraries used are numpy and scikit-image. As for the results, they are exceptional in overcast and clear skies, and the algorithm successfully separates the bright solar area from surrounding clouds, in partly cloudy skies.",

    duration: "2 months",
    details:
      "Worked as Software Engineer, specialized in Web Development, at 7L International. At first, I took two Udemy Courses about React.js and Next.js. Also, I built REST APIs with Next.js and used them to make the Web Apps interact with a MongoDB Database. Alongside, I learned how to work in a team with git and git management systems (GitLab, GitHub). The last three weeks I prepared a Webinar, with a colleague, for the IT Team. The topic was a newly developed framework at that moment, Qwik.js, and a comparison with Remix.js. For the sake of the Webinar I also developed a Qwik.js app for showcase.",

    details:
      "Built a program that searches for and identifies displaced vertices, participating in New Particle Search at Cern. The program was written in C++ and have been developed around ROOT data analysis framework. The aim of the project was to compare the accuracy of algorithmic methods to human input and check how accurate the computer generated results can be. Furthermore, a paper was written so as to aggregate the results of the algorithm development.",

      "My first interaction with a programming language was in the first semester of University, in Computers I class. We were introduced to the basics of C and one of our first assignments was to write a program that calculates a complex integral. I was fascinated by the fact that I could write a program that calculates something that I couldn't do by hand.",
