    duration: "2 months",
    details:
      "Worked as software engineer, specialized in Web Development, at 7L International. At first, I took two Udemy Courses about React.js and Next.js. Also, I built REST APIs with Next.js and used them to make the Web Apps interact with a Database. Alongside, I learned how to work in a team with Git and Git management systems (GitLab, GitHub). The last three weeks I prepared a Webinar for the IT Team about the newly developed framework, Qwik.js, and Remix.js, which is thought as a strong opponent to Next, comparing them. For the sake of the Webinar I also developed a Qwik app for showcase.",
